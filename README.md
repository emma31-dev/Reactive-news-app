# Reactive News App

Real-time on-chain event monitoring, category filtering, price tracking, and educational hub for the Reactive Network ecosystem.

</div>

##  Core Features (Current)

- Deterministic multi-chain event feed (Ethereum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum) generated every 10s
- Aligned 10s client polling with optional pause/resume auto-refresh control + manual refresh
- Sliding window capacity: 500 most recent events (soft buffer trimming just before overflow)
- Persistent cumulative total counter (never resets across sessions)

- Fresh-first fetching strategy with resilient local cache fallback
- Optional optimistic cache bootstrap (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_OPTIMISTIC_CACHE=true`)
- Save-for-later system with local persistence
- New item highlighting (temporary blue pulse indicator + brief Updated pill)
- Pagination (25 events per page) with automatic bounds correction
- Profile preferences & authentication mock (email/password) ‚Äì verification flow planned
- Educational "Learn" section and detailed About page
- Real-time style blockchain-ish metadata: tx hash, from/to, proposal ID, etc. (synthetic)
- Glassmorphism UI + dark/light theme
- Responsive layout (mobile ‚Üí desktop)
- Verification badge component stub (extensible for real chain proofs)

## üß† Caching & Data Strategy & Preferences

The app now uses a fresh-first approach:

1. On mount, it attempts a live fetch from `/api/news`.
2. If the network request fails AND there is no current data, it falls back to `localStorage` (`newsCache`).
3. New items are merged at the top; old items are trimmed to keep a max of 500 (soft buffer keeps us typically at 495 until next batch).
4. New event IDs are tracked in a `Set` to show a temporary "new" visual marker.
5. A success state briefly flashes an "Updated" pill when new events arrive.

### Price Bar Offline Fallback
The price bar now retains and displays the last successfully fetched price if all live API calls fail. Behavior:

| Condition | Display |
|-----------|---------|
| Live fetch succeeds | Fresh price + green pulsing "Live" badge |
| All providers fail, cached price exists | Cached price + amber dot "Offline (cached)" |
| All providers fail, no cached price | N/A values + error flag |

Context adds `offline`, `forceRefresh()`, and `clearCachedPrice()` for manual control. Cached key: `reactPrice:last` in `localStorage`.

### Preference-Based Filtering
Users can toggle which event categories they want to see from the Profile page. Disabled categories are hidden from the feed and their filter pills are disabled. If all categories are disabled, a guidance message appears on the home feed.

Default preferences for new accounts:

| Category | Default | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Whale Watch | ‚úÖ | High-signal large movements |
| Governance | ‚úÖ | Protocol direction & actions |
| Security | ‚ùå | Opt-in (alerts can be noisy) |
| Market | ‚ùå | Optional macro signals |
| DeFi | ‚úÖ | Core ecosystem activity |
| NFT | ‚ùå | Optional vertical |
| Staking | ‚ùå | Operational / validator specific |
| Airdrop | ‚úÖ | High user interest |

Preferences are stored under `authUser` in `localStorage` and automatically migrated when new categories are introduced.

### Optional Optimistic Cache
If you want to immediately show cached events while fetching fresh data, add to `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_OPTIMISTIC_CACHE=true
```

### Clearing the Cache (Programmatic)
`NewsContext` now exposes `clearCache()`. Example usage inside a component:

```tsx
import { useNews } from '@/components/NewsContext';

export function CacheControls() {
	const { clearCache, refreshNews, loadedFromCache } = useNews();
	return (
		<div className="flex gap-2">
			<button onClick={() => { clearCache(); refreshNews(); }} className="px-3 py-1 text-xs rounded bg-indigo-600 text-white">Force Fresh</button>
			{loadedFromCache && <span className="text-xs text-amber-500">(cache)</span>}
		</div>
	);
}
```

## üèó Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Context API for auth, news, price, saved items
- LocalStorage for lightweight persistence

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

## üîß Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` (see `env.example` if present):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_OPTIMISTIC_CACHE` | If `true`, show cached events instantly while fetching fresh. |

### Web3 / Reactive Network Integration

To enable on-chain features, add the following variables (addresses are examples ‚Äî replace with your deployed contract address):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACTIVE_NEWS_CONTRACT=0xYourDeployedContractAddressHere
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACTIVE_CHAIN_ID=5318008
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACTIVE_NETWORK_RPC=https://sepolia-rpc.reactive.network
NEXT_PUBLIC_REACTIVE_NETWORK_EXPLORER=https://sepolia-explorer.reactive.network
```

Deployment Tips:
- Make sure the contract address is NOT the zero address or the UI will show "Contract not ready".
- If you change chain ID, also update RPC + Explorer endpoints accordingly.
- After updating `.env.local`, restart `npm run dev` (Next.js only reads env vars at process start).
- In production (e.g. Vercel), set these in the project Environment Variables UI (scope: Production + Preview).

Runtime Diagnostics:
- Use the Profile page wallet panel to view `WalletDiagnostics`.
- If on the wrong network, a yellow warning will prompt you to switch.
- Contract initialization problems (missing/invalid address) are surfaced in red.
- The connect button attempts to auto-add the Reactive network if MetaMask doesn't have it.

Common Issues:
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Contract not initialized" errors in console | Zero or invalid contract address | Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_REACTIVE_NEWS_CONTRACT` correctly |
| Always shows wrong network | MetaMask not on chain 5318008 | Click Switch Network button or add chain manually |
| Events not updating on-chain | Using mock backend only | Deploy / integrate real indexer + contract calls |
| `wallet_switchEthereumChain` fails with 4902 | Chain not added | The code auto-attempts add; approve MetaMask prompt |

## üìÅ Key Folders

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/` | Routes & layout (App Router) |
| `components/` | Reusable UI + context providers |
| `app/api/news/` | Mock news generation API (in-memory) |
| `public/` | Static assets |
| `contracts/` | Solidity contract stubs |

## üß™ Mock Data Generation (Deterministic, Stateless)

`/api/news` now derives the feed purely from wall-clock time ‚Äì no in-memory timers to break in serverless / cold start environments. Each 10‚Äësecond interval since a fixed anchor timestamp yields a deterministic set of synthetic events (one per supported chain). The server reconstructs the most recent intervals on demand and returns at most the latest 500 events (multi-chain expansion drastically increases freshness versus single-source generation).

ID Strategy:
- Each interval has an index (monotonically increasing since anchor)
- Each chain event inside that interval is composed into a unique ID (e.g. `<interval>-<chainKey>`)
- This guarantees stability (same request within the same interval returns identical IDs) and continuity (no resets after deployments).

Benefits:
- Consistent behavior across serverless cold starts (no duplication or regression)
- Easy to reason about upper bounds (500 window) and cadence (10s)
- Enables client polling alignment and pause/resume without race conditions

## üîÑ Polling & Updates (Aligned 10s Cadence)

- Server conceptually "generates" (derives) a new multi-chain batch every 10 seconds
- Client polls every 10 seconds (aligned) while auto-refresh is enabled
- Auto-refresh can be paused (stops network calls) and resumed via UI toggle
- Manual Refresh button triggers an immediate fetch regardless of auto state
- New events merged at top; oldest trimmed to maintain 500 window
- Cumulative total increments even when items fall out of the window

### Auto-Refresh Control
`NewsContext` exposes:
- `autoRefresh` (boolean)
- `pauseAutoRefresh()` / `resumeAutoRefresh()`
- `refreshNews()` (manual on-demand fetch)

UI shows a Stop / Resume button plus an Updated pill when new items arrive.

## üß© Extensibility Ideas

- Replace mock API with real blockchain indexer
- Add WebSocket / Server-Sent Events for push updates
- Integrate wallet auth + signatures
- Persist cache in IndexedDB with expiry TTL
- Add category count badges to filter buttons

## üêõ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Only Whale Watch events show | Multi-chain deterministic generator produces balanced synthetic mix; if filtering hides others, adjust preferences. |
| Data appears stale | Click Refresh, or call `clearCache()` then refresh. |
| Build fails with unescaped quotes | Escape `'` as `&apos;` and `"` as `&quot;` in JSX text. |
